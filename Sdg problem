SDG 2: Zero Hunger
Problem:
Food Insecurity in Underserved Communities

Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet dietary needs.
Many underserved communities face difficulties in obtaining food due to economic and social factors.
Proposed Solution:
We aim to design a database system to improve the distribution of food donations in underserved regions, ensuring that food reaches those in need in a more organized, accountable, and efficient manner. The system will track donors, food distribution centers, and recipients, providing transparency and improving decision-making regarding where to allocate resources.

Objectives:
Track and manage food donations from various sources (donors).
Record the distribution of food to communities through centers.
Analyze and report on the effectiveness of the distribution process
